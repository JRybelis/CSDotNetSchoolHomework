## Homework 1

### Task 1

Create a console application, which asks the user for two integers ``a`` and ``b`` (assume
that the user enters integers without errors).

The application then prints all integers in the range from a (inclusive) to b (inclusive) that have exactly two 2's in their ternary
number system (0, 1, 2) representation.
